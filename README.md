# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description
- Use Javascript to develop a random password generator that prompts the user the length and if they want to include symbols,
lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and numbers. 
- What I have learned from this challenge is Javascript coding including the use of variables, prompts/confirms, for/while loops, if statements, Math.random/Math.floor, .push(), .join(), parseInt function, NaN property, length property, nested arrays, and functions.
- The most difficult part of this challenge is the randomizing of nested arrays. One bug that I am still encountering includes having a minimum of at least 1 of each type of character in the generated password.


## Ordered Steps of completion
- Step 1: Prompt the user to input how long they want their password and save as variable.
- Step 2: Check the variable to make sure its a number and fits the guideline of 8-128 characters.
- Step 3: Prompt the user to ask if they want numbers, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and symbols. Save as variables.
- Step 4: Push requested arrays in individial user request array if true.
- Step 5: Use for loop to push requested amount of random characters from array into password array.
- Step 6: Convert password array into string.
- Step 7: Return randomly generated password.


## User Story
- AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
- I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
- SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

## Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN I need a new, secure password
- WHEN I click the button to generate a password
- THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
- WHEN prompted for password criteria
- THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
- WHEN prompted for the length of the password
- THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
- WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
- THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
- WHEN I answer each prompt
- THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
- WHEN all prompts are answered
- THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
- WHEN the password is generated
- THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
